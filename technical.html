        <p> <h2>Project Architecture</h2></p>
        <p>The website was desinged to be a tutoring tool that linked all the lesson pages
        together. The home page features information on how the website is used as a teaching
      platform. The lessons tab come equipped with a drop down menu allowing you to choose 
    the lessons to study in any order. After the lesson is read a small multiple choice quiz 
  is given at the bottom of each document.</p>
  <p>After each multiple choice quiz is submitted, our database is accessed with PHP code and 
  the score is tallied and represented at the top of the page. Below is an example of the PHP 
code used to access the database.</p>
<p><img src="images/phpShot.png" id="phpShot"/></p>
  <p>After the user goes through all of the lessons they can go to the final challenge. This is
   a minigame created where an arrow is traveling through a maze and you guide it's direction 
 based on the buttons filled with code.  When you arrive at the end there is a notification letting you know you have beat the game.</p>
 <p><h2>Business Logic</h2></p>
 <p>The idea behind our website would ultimately be to market it to schools as a learning platform. It is purposefully designed for the skill level of a younger child to easily start understaning coding logic. The use of quizzes and games are to hold the attention of the user since they are younger than the average internet user.</p>
 <p><h2>Database Design</h2></p>
 <p>Our database was designed with MySQL and it is accessed with PHP. The lessons we created are PHP files that contain PHP and HTML in them.  Each lesson page accesses the database through it's own PHP code.  Here is an example of the MySQL code used to create the database.</p>
 <p><img src="images/dbShot.png" id="dbShot"/></p>
 <p>Here is an example of some of the PHP code from the arrays lesson page:</p>
 <p><img src="images/arrayShot.png" id="arrayShot"/></p>
 <p><h2>Special Features</h2></p>
 <p>Our website features a minigame to test the user's knowledge of the lessons after they have read through them and completed the multiple choice quizzes.  The game consists of an arrow on a game board with a certain path highlighted. The user must select the correct coding button to make the arrow travel in the corresponding direction to follow the path. If the user chooses the wrong direction they are notified that they have lost the game and that they need to refresh the page to play it again. If the player successfully completes the challenge then they are notified of their vicotry!</p>
